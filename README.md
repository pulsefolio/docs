Welcome to the official documentation for Pulsefolio - the all in one PulseChain Dashboard.

## About Pulsefolio

Pulsefolio is built exclusively for PulseChain — a non-custodial dashboard where every wallet, token, NFT, and on-chain action comes together. This isn't just another tracker. Pulsefolio is the identity layer and dashboard for PulseChain, giving you the ability to create profiles, explore assets, and stay connected — all in one place, powered by the chain you use every day.

## Features

### 🏠 Portfolio
Your Pulsefolio portfolio brings everything you hold on PulseChain into one clear view. From core tokens like PLS, PLSX, INC, and HEX to other blue chips and onboarded projects, every balance is tracked with live on-chain pricing, USD values, and 24-hour changes.

### 🎨 Digital Collectibles
Browse your PulseChain NFT collection in a clean grid or detailed list view, complete with thumbnails for quick recognition. Each collectible displays its estimated value, rarity ranking, and full trait details.

### 📊 Recent Activity
Stay on top of everything happening in your wallet with Pulsefolio's Recent Activity feed. Every token transfer, NFT move, PulseX liquidity add or remove, and staking action is captured in one organized stream.

### 👥 Community Connections
Pulsefolio is more than a portfolio tracker — it's where the PulseChain community comes together. Profiles can be made public, allowing you to share your on-chain presence with a name, avatar, and bio.

### 🚀 Project Onboarding
Pulsefolio gives projects the ability to showcase themselves directly to the PulseChain community. To ensure safety and quality, every project must go through an onboarding process before being listed.

### 🎁 Referrals & Rewards
Every registered wallet on Pulsefolio receives a unique referral link. Sharing this link allows you to invite new users to the platform and grow the Pulsefolio community.

### 🐋 Whale Tracking
Track the largest wallets in real time and see when they buy, sell, stake, or adjust liquidity positions. You can build custom watchlists of wallets you care about most.

### 💎 Premium
Pulsefolio will include a Premium tier for users who want access to enhanced features beyond the core experience.

### 🔄 Swap
Pulsefolio includes a built-in swap feature powered by a DEX aggregator. This allows users to trade tokens directly inside the dashboard while automatically routing through the best available rates across PulseChain.
