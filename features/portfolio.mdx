## Complete Position Tracking

Liquidity positions on PulseX are displayed with full breakdowns of the underlying tokens, so you can always see exactly what you're providing and how it's performing. Staked positions are also included, showing both the amount staked and the rewards you're earning in real time.

Beyond balances, Pulsefolio calculates profit and loss (PnL) across your wallet, tokens, LPs, and staking activity. This gives you a true picture of performance over time, whether you're farming yields, locking tokens for rewards, or trading actively.
