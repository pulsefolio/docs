## The PulseChain Dashboard

Pulsefolio is built exclusively for PulseChain — a non-custodial dashboard where every wallet, token, NFT, and on-chain action comes together.

This isn't just another tracker. Pulsefolio is the identity layer and dashboard for PulseChain, giving you the ability to create profiles, explore assets, and stay connected — all in one place, powered by the chain you use every day.

## Why Pulsefolio Exists

PulseChain is fast, efficient, and home to some of the most passionate communities in crypto. With major tokens like HEX, PLS, PLSX, and INC driving activity, there's a constant need for clear visibility and smarter tools.

Pulsefolio was created to meet that need: a single platform to track, manage, and connect across PulseChain without ever giving up control of your wallet.
